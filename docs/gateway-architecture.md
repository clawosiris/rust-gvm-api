# Gateway Architecture

This document is the repository-local architecture reference for `rust-gvm-api`.
It reflects the design intent captured in [issue #26](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm-api/issues/26), the shared session/connection model from [issue #27](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm-api/issues/27), and the current repository shape on `main`.

## Core Rules

- The gateway follows a ports-and-adapters (hexagonal) architecture.
- `rust-gvm-api` must not parse raw GMP XML directly.
  All GMP XML parsing and protocol-shape handling belong in `rust-gvm`; the gateway consumes typed models and protocol APIs from `rust-gvm`.
- `rust-gvm-api` must not locally construct GMP command XML or normalize GMP wire/display values.
  If a gateway change needs that behavior, the implementation stops and the missing typed support is reported against [`greenbone-hive/rust-gvm`](https://github.com/greenbone-hive/rust-gvm) instead.
- REST, gRPC, and future MCP are peer incoming adapters over one shared execution core.
- The public GMP ticket surface is intentionally limited to list/get discovery.
  Ticket lifecycle expansion is excluded by the
  [GMP ticket surface decision](ticket-surface-scope.md).
- The domain layer owns session lifecycle rules and invariants, but does not hold live I/O handles.
- The gvmd outgoing adapter owns live backend connections, session-bound command serialization, and transport concerns.
- The current deployment target is a single gateway instance with in-memory session and connection state.
- Transport security must be explicit: plain HTTP (`disabled`), proxy-terminated HTTP (`terminated_by_proxy`), or native HTTPS (`native`).
- Trace correlation uses OpenTelemetry plus W3C Trace Context at the public adapter boundary.

## Current Workspace Shape

The authoritative workspace members are defined in the root `Cargo.toml`:

```text
crates/gvm-gateway-domain
crates/gvm-gateway-app
crates/gvm-gateway-rest
crates/gvm-gateway-gvmd
crates/gvm-gateway
```

Their responsibilities are:

- `gvm-gateway-domain`: session entities, lifecycle/state rules, port traits, domain errors.
- `gvm-gateway-app`: shared use cases and orchestration over the domain and ports.
- `gvm-gateway-rest`: REST incoming adapter, HTTP translation, security middleware, request/response mapping.
- `gvm-gateway-gvmd`: gvmd outgoing adapter built on `rust-gvm`.
- `gvm-gateway`: composition root, config loading, listener/bootstrap, tracing init, shutdown wiring.

## Adapter Status

- REST is the implemented public adapter on `main`.
- gRPC remains a planned adapter and contract surface; its spec should align to this architecture, but it is not wired into the default workspace build today.
- MCP is planned as another peer adapter over the same application core; it is not yet implemented.

```

## Session and Backend Ownership

- Incoming adapters authenticate/translate requests but do not own backend sessions.
- The domain layer owns session identity, limits, expiry, and lifecycle decisions.
- The gvmd adapter owns authenticated backend connections and per-session execution serialization.
- Shared use cases in `gvm-gateway-app` coordinate those responsibilities without leaking transport/framework concerns into the domain.

## Shared Session Execution Model

- Persistent sessions are the shared execution model for multi-request workflows across REST and planned gRPC.
- A successful session bootstrap yields an opaque bearer token that identifies one authenticated gateway session.
- The domain `SessionManager` owns:
  - token generation and lookup
  - per-user and global session limits
  - idle-expiry rules
  - explicit teardown and invalidation
- The gvmd adapter owns:
  - the live authenticated backend connection bound to a session token
  - single-flight execution on that connection
  - backend disconnect detection and cleanup
- Requests that resolve to the same session token must execute serially against gvmd.
- Queue saturation and per-request timeouts are backpressure events, not silent retries or reordering.

## Session Lifecycle Shape

1. The client authenticates and creates a gateway session.
2. The gateway authenticates against gvmd and binds the resulting backend connection to a new opaque session token.
3. Subsequent adapter calls resolve that token through the same shared application/domain path.
4. Every successful command dispatch refreshes the session's idle-expiry window.
5. Explicit teardown, idle expiry, or backend disconnect invalidates the token and closes the bound connection.

## Transport-Security Note

Issue `#27` originally assumed TLS-only public transport. The current repository has since refined that into the explicit shared transport-security contract from issue `#130`:

- `disabled` for intentional plain HTTP
- `terminated_by_proxy` for HTTP behind a trusted TLS-terminating proxy
- `native` for direct HTTPS from the gateway process

That newer transport contract supersedes the older blanket "no plain HTTP" assumption while leaving the session/connection architecture from `#27` intact.

## Development Implications

- Architecture discussions and new adapter work should update this document together with issue `#26` when the design changes materially.
- The GMP boundary architecture test is an executable guard for the `rust-gvm` ownership rule.
  New local GMP command construction, response parsing, or wire/display-name normalization in `gvm-gateway-gvmd` is a stop-and-report event, not a reason to add another gateway workaround.
- Shared session/connection behavior changes should stay aligned with issue `#27` or its successor issues.
- Coverage audits and adapter-parity plans should treat ticket operations beyond
  the existing list/get surface as a deliberate exclusion, not a missing endpoint.
- Specs under `spec/rest-api/` and `spec/grpc-api/` should treat this document as the architectural source of truth.
- Repo docs must distinguish clearly between:
  - implemented gateway surfaces on `main`
  - planned adapter surfaces
  - exploratory or legacy artifacts that are not part of the current workspace composition root
